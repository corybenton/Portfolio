# Portfolio
## Name
The portfolio for Cory Benton

## Description
This is a front-facing page for the project portfolio put together by Cory Benton.  Eventually when there are projects to add, it will link to those projects repositories. Currently, the project pictures will highlight when hovered.  Also, the nav bar will move you to the appropriate section on the page.  In the contact section, the Github will move you to my profile on Github and the email will open up your mail program.

## Visuals
The website should look like this.

## Authors and acknowledgment
The background image of the bookshelf is a picture from youtube by Rick Koeppen.  I got the art for the project images from professionalresumewriters.net, dglobaltech.com, Clipart Panda, Dreamstime, colourbox.com, and clipartstation.  The background image of the main section with the circles is from clipart craft.  Assistance on the project was provided through BCS Learning Assistant by J.K. (jroyston) and Mia (dilberovicm36).
